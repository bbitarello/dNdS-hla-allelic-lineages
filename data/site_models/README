#This directory contains input alignment and tree files for all site models
#(codon models)  analyses (performed in CODEML)  mentioned in the paper.

#codeml_A_nuc_all.ctl #example of control file for the HLA-A locus, prior to
#removal of recombinants, initial omega=0.4.
#Note that NSsites is set to 0 1 2 7 8 to run all these models at once (one
run).

#All files that start with A are alignment files for HLA-A
#CR: datasets prior to removal of recombinant sequences
#SR: datasets after removal of recombinant sequences
#Tree files are in Newick format and wer egenerated with the program NEIGHBOR,
from the PHYLIP package, after running DNADIST on these alignment files. (see
the paper for details).
