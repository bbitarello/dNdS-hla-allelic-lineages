#Input alignment files for CODEML analyses
#codeml_A_ars_m0.ctl  #example control file for pairwise analyses (HLA-A, NARS
#dataset, prior to removal of recombinants, se below).

#The files in this directory were used for all pairwise analyses (CODEML)
described in the main paper.

#CR: datasets prior to removal of intragenic recombinants.
#SR: datasets after removal of intragenic recombinants.

#ARS: alignment containing only ARS codons (Bjorkman et al. 1987)
#NARS: alignment containg only non-ARS codons. This includes all codons between
exons 2-6 (HLA-A and HLA-C) and 2-7 (HLA-B), minus the ARS codons.
