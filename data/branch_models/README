#This directory contains input alignment and tree files for all site models
#(branch models)  analyses (performed in CODEML)  mentioned in the paper.


#All files that start with A are alignment files for HLA-A
#NR: datasets after removal of recombinant sequences. For these analyses, only
#NR datasets were used. 
#Tree files are in Newick format and wer egenerated with the program NEIGHBOR,
#from the PHYLIP package, after running DNADIST on these alignment files. (see
#the paper for details).


#ARS: dataset containing only ARS codons (Bjorkman et al. 1987)
#NARS: dataset containing only non-ARS codons (see main paper).

#A_final: unrooted tree (Newick format) for running analyses for both the ARS
#(A_ars_NR_prunned.phy) and NARS (A_nars_NR_prunned.phy_) datasets, for model=0
#(one omega), i.e,no labels in the tree.
#
##A_2a_final: unrooted tree (Newick format) for running analyses for both the
#ARS and NARS datasets, for model=2 (two omegas), i.e, with labels for
#INTRA-INTER branches.


##A_2b_final: unrooted tree (Newick format) for running analyses for both the
#ARS (A_ars_NR_prunned.phy) and NARS (A_nars_NR_prunned.phy) datasets, for model=2 (two omegas), i.e, with labels for
#INTERNEL-TERMINAL branches.
#
#The same applies for HLA-B and HLA-C
