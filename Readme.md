Here we provide the data used for each set of analyses: pairwise, site models, branch models 
#and 100 Genomes analyses, as described in the paper.


#CR: datasets prior to removal of intragenic recombinants.
#SR: datasets after removal of intragenic recombinants.

#ARS: alignment containing only ARS codons (Chelvanaygam 1996)
#NARS: alignment containg only non-ARS codons. This includes all codons between
#exons 2-6 (HLA-A and HLA-C) and 2-7 (HLA-B), minus the ARS codons.
